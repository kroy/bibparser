### Biblioparser

This is a little project for me to learn python with. The idea is to take some
 representation of a bibliography and a bibliography format, and to produce a
 "parsed" version of it. This might be used to create a searchable, electronic
  bibliography. Or something.

  Right now there's some major problems. Mainly that bibliography formats are
  meant to be understood by humans, not computers. I'll need to get around
  issues like abbreviated initials, quoted titles of works, overlapping
  citation rules for sources of different formats etc.
